# RNN NLP Tasks with Keras

## Tasks:
1. Text Classification (Math, Science, History, English)
2. Next Word Generation (Science-based corpus)

## Files:
- classification_dataset.csv
- science_corpus.txt
- classification_model.py
- text_generation_model.py

## Results:
- Classification Accuracy: ~90%
- Sample Generated Text:
  "The solar system consists of the sun and the planets that orbit around the sun and are called the solar system and..."

## How to Run:
- `python RNN_NLP.py`
# RNN-NLP
You are required to design and implement a single, simple RNN model that can perform two distinct NLP tasks
