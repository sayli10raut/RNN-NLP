Science is the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence. The scientific method involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, and formulating hypotheses. Modern science is divided into three major branches: natural sciences, social sciences, and formal sciences. Physics, chemistry, and biology are traditional natural sciences. Scientific research often involves experiments and data collection.
